# Museums
Stockolm is one of the most museum-dense cities of Europe. Up until 2023, many of those museums were free, however starting from this year you have to have an entrance fee in some of them. [Here](http://www.stockholmmuseums.se/en/nearby) you can find a list of all the museums in Stockholm, so if you see something that catches your eye we can include this in the itinerary.
