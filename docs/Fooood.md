- **Tokyo ramen** <a name="tokyoramen"></a>


A classic option, very central as well. Tokyo ramen has been our to go place for a while now. You can find their menu [here](https://www.tokyoramen.se/). A good-sized bowl of ramen normally coasts around 135 sek.

- **SIN ramen lounge** <a name="sinramen"></a>

Together with Tokyo ramne, it is one of the best rated places in the city. We still haven't tried it, but have heard very good things about it. If we go, we will need a reservation, so we have to plan ahead of time, also the menu changes by day, so make sure you check the day menu in their site.
SIN ramen longe has a [lunch menu](https://www.sinramen.se/lunch) on weekdays from 11-14 for 149 sek, or a [dinner menu](https://www.sinramen.se/dinner) for 169 sek.

- **AI Ramen Klara** <a name="airamen"></a>

Also a good centric option with handmade noodles, but a bit pricier than the others. You can find the menu [here](https://www.airamen.se/food).
