# Ramen places <a name="ramen"></a> 
**Tokyo ramen** <a name="tokyoramen"></a>

<p align="justify">
A classic option, very central as well. Tokyo ramen has been our to go place for a while now. You can find their menu <a href="https://www.tokyoramen.se">here</a>. A good-sized bowl of ramen normally coasts around 135 sek.

</p>
<br>
**SIN ramen lounge** <a name="sinramen"></a>
<p align="justify">
Together with Tokyo ramne, it is one of the best rated places in the city. We still haven't tried it, but have heard very good things about it. If we go, we will need a reservation, so we have to plan ahead of time, also the menu changes by day, so make sure you check the day menu in their site.
SIN ramen longe has a <a href="https://www.sinramen.se/lunch">lunch menu</a> on weekdays from 11-14 for 149 sek, or a <a href="https://www.sinramen.se/dinner">dinner menu</a> for 169 sek.

</p>
<br>
**AI Ramen Klara** <a name="airamen"></a>

<p align="justify">
Also a good centric option with handmade noodles, but a bit pricier than the others. You can find the menu <a href="https://www.airamen.se/food">here</a>. No reservation is needed, and prices are normally around 180 sek per person, but they also offer weekdays lunch deals for 165 sek per person on weekdays from 11-15.

# Swedish food <a name="swedish_food"></a>

<p align="justify">
Swedish meatballs (köttbullar) are known for their tender texture and savory taste, making them a popular dish both in Sweden and around the world. Whether enjoyed as a main course with mashed potatoes and lingonberry sauce or served as a delightful appetizer, Swedish meatballs are a true delight for food enthusiasts seeking a taste of Swedish cuisine.
</p>

**IKEA** <a name="ikea"></a>

<p align="justify">
It cannot get anymore swedish than this! Ikea meatballs have gained worldwide fame as a signature dish offered at Ikea stores across the globe, and have become an iconic part of the Ikea experience. See <a href="https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/stores/restaurant/restaurangen-pub103ef3b0">menu</a>. As of 2023, a plate with 12 meatballs costs as little as 59 sek.

</p>
<br>

**Kvarnen** <a name="kvarnen"></a> 
<p align="justify">
A hidden local gem founded in 1908. The name kvarnen means 'the mill', and it is an adaptation of its original name grå kvarn (gray mill), given after the gray mill tha stood on this place between 1600s and 1800s. This place was originally recommended by one of our swedish friends. Kvarnen serves a bast variety of traditional swedish food and offers a lunch weekly selection (veckans meny) of dishes Monday-Friday from 11–15 for 155 sek per person. The meny changes every week, but you can find it in this <a href="https://www.kvarnen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dagens-kvarn-2.pdf">link</a>.

# Sushi<a name="sushi"></a>
<p align="justify">
Sushi is just awesome in Stockholm, there are many places where to go, but we always end up going back to the same place:
</p>
**ESA Sushi** <a name="esa"></a>
<p align="justify">
Although there are several good places, many of our friends agree that ESA/YUME sushi is the best! We don't need to say much, but their poke bowls, dumplings and sushies are VERY tasty. ESA/YUME sushi has several locations around the city, and most of the cases a big portion of sushi is around 150 sek. <a href="https://www.yumesushi.se/meny">here</a> you can find their whole menu. 
</p>

</p>
<br>

**Mae Thai**<a name="maethai"></a>
<p align="justify">
A not very fancy but very tasty option for lunch. Mae thai offers a daily menu Monday-Friday from 10-14:30 for 129 sek for most dishes in the menu. Karolinksa Mae Thai also offers a lunch buffet for the same price. <a href="https://www.maethaiwok.com/thai-meny/">Here</a> you can find their menu.

<br>

# Indian food <a name="indian-food"></a>

**Chili masala**<a name="chili-masala"></a>
<p align="justify">
This place is a bit outside the city, but has been one of my favorite places to have indian food. This is a punjabi-approved place to have amazing food for a very reasonable price. Like most places, chili masala offers a changing lunch menu on weekdays 11-14 for 110 sek <a href="https://chilimasala.se/lunch/">here</a> you can find their lunch menu, and <a href="https://chilimasala.se/meny/">here</a> their full menu.

# Fika <a name="fika"></a>
<p align="justify">
Fika is an integral part of Swedish culture and a cherished tradition. It refers to a break or moment of relaxation where people come together to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea accompanied by pastries, cakes, or sandwiches. Fika is more than just a coffee break; it represents a social ritual that encourages bonding, connection, and a sense of community. Swedes prioritize taking regular fika breaks throughout the day, whether at work, home, or in cafes. It's a time to unwind, catch up with friends or colleagues, and indulge in a sweet treat. Fika embodies the Swedish values of work-life balance, slowing down, and appreciating the simple pleasures in life. It's a wonderful way to pause, recharge, and savor the moment amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life in Sweden.

Of course our itinerary will include some 'Fikapauser' so pick your favorite!
</p>

**Mr. cake**<a name="mrcake"></a>
<p align="justify">
This is with no doubts, one of our absolute favorite places in Stockholm for Fika (and also brunch). <a href="https://mrcake.se/">Mr. cake</a> has a wide selection of traditional and innovative pastries that you will love (or we hope you will)!. It is also a very centrical place, so we likely can stop by one of the days.

</p>

**Moderna museet caffee**<a name="moderna"></a>
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/sv/besok-museet/mat-dryck/"> The moderna museum cafe</a>  is one of my favorite views to have fika in the city. This cozy cafe is situated inside the museum of modern art (moderna), and offers coffee and some sweets with an amazing view! The only downside is that is regularly closes at 5 pm, so we will need to arrive early.
